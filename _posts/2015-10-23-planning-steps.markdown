After meeting with our clients last week we have begun getting a clearer understanding of what our service will provide and the modules required to provide this. Over this week we have worked on defining some general architecture of how this project will accomplish the task at hand, thanks to Andy's prototype sketches. 

This week we were also able to find a researcher to meet with and help drive the use cases for the project. Anne Nolin from the Mountain Hydro climatology Research Group.  

We were also able to schedule our meeting time with our client for next week. Next we will be working on creating a requirements document and discuss next steps.â€‹
