Welcome to the Capstone Project Blog for Group 37

​For this week, we worked on creating our group project page and blog along with turning in a hard copy of our problem statement. We also had a meeting with our project proposer Lewis McGibbney and his two colleagues Charles Thompson and Chris Mattmann. ​

The next things for us to do is to start looking into writing our requirements document.
