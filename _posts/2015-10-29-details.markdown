​This week the team worked through planning out how we are going to structure the project.

We studied research that might indicate how our solution might help research and talked through our understanding of the project. With that knowledge created the requirements document.

Our client was able to throughly review the document and raised some potential conserns for us to fix.

Next week we are going to be starting to draft out some more details about our solution at a lower level as well as record some solid use cases.
