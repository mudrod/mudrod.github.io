Thank you for dropping by, you've arrived at the official MUDROD website. From here you will find everything you need in order to become engaged with MUDROD.

First things, first however... we bet you are asking "What MUDROD mean?" 

The answer... in a nutchshell it represents **M**ining and **U**tilizing **D**ataset **R**elevancy from **O**ceanographic **D**atasets to Improve Data Discovery. The project was funded in 2015 as an Access project funded by NASA AIST (Grant No. NNX15AM85G).

So, please make yourself at home and **subscribe to our [RSS Feed](https://mudrod.github.io/feed.xml) for updates**.
